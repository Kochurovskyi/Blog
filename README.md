## MERN Stack

The project is built using the MERN stack, which includes the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data - in AWS replaced with DynamoDB
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js used to build the server-side of the application.
- **React**: A library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.

## Artificial Intelligence Integration

This project leverages artificial intelligence to enhance the user experience. We have integrated AI models for nice text edition and translation to English, and using the generated English version to create descriptive images. This makes the application more intelligent and fun.

## Deployment on AWS Services

The project is deployed on AWS services to ensure high availability and scalability. We use the following AWS services:

- **Amazon S3**: For storing static files and media content, and for image storage.
- **AWS CloudFront**: For content delivery and caching.
- **Elastic Load Balancing**: For distributing incoming application traffic.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: For deploying and managing applications.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: For managing the database.
